What have you done to OpenWrt?

- Removed all stuff relating to targets other than the Bifferboard
- Remove all stuff not relating to 2.6.37.6 kernel
- Removed all scripts that aren't directly needed for the build
- Kept Bifferboard related configuration
- Avoided the need to do make package/symlinks, in order to avoid the
  packages getting out of step with the core distribution

What have you done to Qemu?

- Removed all non-x86 target stuff and basically any files not 
  needed for support of Bifferboard emulation.
